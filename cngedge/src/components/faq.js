                    <h2>How will adding CNG / LPG to my diesel engine save me money and extend my Run-time?</h2>
                        (1) Your diesel engine will actually run on a portion of natural gas and that natural gas will replace a portion of diesel that is normally used to power your engine. Pipeline natural gas averages 43 inr per kg, equivalent of diesel fuel and compressed natural gas averages around . Compare that to diesel at 73 inr per liter and it's easy to see the savings. You save money because you are running on a less expensive fuel.
                        <br/>
                        (2) Natural gas is high octane with an octane rating of 120-130. When this high octane fuel is ignited it burns hotter than diesel and actually helps to burn up any unused diesel/oxygen that would normally be wasted out the exhaust pipe. Less waste = better efficiency and better efficiency = savings.
                        <br/>   
                        (3) Because of the high octane rating of natural gas it adds torque to your engine. This added power propels your engine down the road with less effort. Less effort = less fuel used.
                        <br/>
                        (4) Running your any diesel engine on 50%-80% pipeline natural gas you will extend your run-time by 50-80%. In a emergency situation where diesel fuel could be limited or rationed that is huge!

                        <h2>Can I use CNG / LPG / LPG if I have a diesel particulate filter DPF installed?</h2>
                        YES! Running CNG / LPG will actually help keep your DPF clean and clog free. Because you will be using a much cleaner fuel there is less soot and ash to deposit in your DPF

                        <h2>Will adding natural gas to my diesel harm my engine?</h2>
                        When adjusted properly running natural gas is actually BETTER for your engine then running diesel alone. Natural gas is a clean burning fuel, diesel is not. When you fuel on natural gas you are running on a cleaner fuel and the result is a cleaner engine. Natural gas helps to burn any unspent fuel and soot that can clog up engine and exhaust components.

                        YES.Natural Gas vehicles are actually SAFER than traditional gasoline or diesel vehicles.
